# 📚 Findability – Internal Information Suite

An AI-powered internal platform at BCG designed to streamline access to organizational knowledge, tools, and documentation for employees across functions. The initiative focused on improving the *findability* of content using structured taxonomy, stakeholder collaboration, and system enhancements.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Findability** project aimed to reduce time spent by employees in locating relevant information across disparate platforms by introducing an intelligent, centralized discovery layer. It was part of BCG’s broader digital enablement initiative focused on knowledge management transformation.

Key features included:
- An internal chatbot for querying tools, documentation, and workflows
- Structured knowledge base integration (e.g., Confluence, legacy systems)
- Platform-wide content discoverability improvements
- User-specific recommendations and search refinements

## 👨‍💻 My Role – Product Analyst Intern

As a Product Analyst on the project, I worked at the intersection of product design, data, and user operations. My contributions included:

- **Data Discovery & Sanitization**: Audited legacy documentation, removed redundancies, and ensured information hygiene across internal sources.
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identified and coordinated with 10+ key stakeholders from product, ops, and functional teams across geographies to gather requirements and validate workflows.
- **Project Scoping**: Helped define the MVP for the chatbot and discovery flow based on internal usage patterns and feedback loops.
- **UI Testing**: Led QA efforts across chatbot UX, ensuring usability and reducing false positives in results.
- **Process Improvement**: Suggested structure changes in content tagging that improved content retrieval speed and accuracy.
- **Sprint Ceremonies**: Actively participated in sprint planning, backlog grooming, and daily standups following Agile Scrum methodology.
